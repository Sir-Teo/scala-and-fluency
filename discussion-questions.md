#  How much time did you spend on this assignment?

The time is estimated.
My computer had lots of problems in setting up the IntelliJ program. It probably took me at least 3 hours to do that.

Adding fluency to the picture program and practicing scala functions is quite easy. I spend at most 2.5 hours.

# Discussion questions / topics
Below, add one or two things that you might want to discuss when we meet again.
