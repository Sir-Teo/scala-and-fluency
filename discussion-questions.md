#  How much time did you spend on this assignment?

The time is estimated.
My computer had lots of problems in setting up the IntelliJ program. It probably took me at least 3 hours to do that.

Adding fluency to the picture program and practicing scala functions is quite easy. I spend at most 2.5 hours.

# Discussion questions / topics
Below, add one or two things that you might want to discuss when we meet again.

-we can talk more about how to implement a DSL. Are we doing a DSL in modifying the Picture program?

-more practise in using Scala. I still don't feel comfortable in using Scala. I definitely need more practise in it. 

-explain more about "fluency". Does "fluency" means making the program shorter? or it means to make the program easier to read?
